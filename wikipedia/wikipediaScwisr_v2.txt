The '''Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology''' (SCWIST), founded in 1981<ref name = "Year of foundation">{{cite web|title=SFU Archive|url=http://www.sfu.ca/archives2/F-39/F-39.html|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]] |date=2012-08-01}}</ref> , is a [[not-for-profit]] association that promotes, encourages and empowers women and girls in science, engineering and technology<ref name = " Registered charity source 1">{{cite web|title=Registered Canadian charities|url=https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/society-for-canadian-women-in-science-and-technology|publisher=Canada Helps|accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref>. SCWIST is a society '''OF''' all genders working together '''FOR''' women. 

==Mission<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=C|title=Dr Maria Issa, President and Dr Julie Wong, Director, Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology|url=http://www.research-europe.com/index.php/2012/12/dr-maria-issa-president-and-dr-julie-wong-director-society-for-canadian-women-in-science-and-technology/|publisher=Research Media Ltd|location=Bristol, UK|access-date=2015-06-28|date=2012-12-28|quote=JW: I think that in comparison to other countries Canada fares better in terms of the position of women in science and technology: the image of a female scientist is, for the most part, recognised. Our CAN $100 bank note shows a female scientist on it; however, the image of a female scientist in Canada is multifaceted. Canada is a country that is built on immigration and the ethnicity of visible minorities is something that has created controversy.}}</ref>==
SCWIST promotes and empowers women working in science, engineering and technology to grow, develop, and succeed in their fields, as well as encourage and provide assistance to young women pursuing their dreams of a career in science.
The Society works
*to promote equal opportunities for women in scientific, technological and engineering careers;
*to improve social attitudes on the stereotyping of careers in science and educate the public about careers in science and technology; and
*to assist educators by providing current information on careers and career training, science and scientific policies.
It realizes these goals through the organization of conferences and networking events, delivery of public educational outreach programs, production of resource material (videos, publications and handbooks), liaison with other organizations, and participation in granting, advocacy and advisory bodies.

==History==
The Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology (SCWIST) was founded in Vancouver, BC in 1981<ref name = "Year of foundation" /> by six women: Mary Vickers, Hilda Ching<ref>{{cite report | last= Ching |first= Hilda |title=Hilda Ching's Final Report as Ruth Wynn Woodward Professor|url= http://summit.sfu.ca/item/10431|publisher=Simon Fraser University|format=pdf|date=1991|quote= When the National Committee for Women in Engineering was being organized, I participated for SCWIST in discussions on the kind of research which should be done to increase numbers of women engineers.}}</ref>, Abby Schwarz, Mary Jo Duncan, Diana Herbst and [[Margaret Benston]]. SCWIST is a volunteer non-profit organization incorporated under the BC Societies Act; in 1984 it was registered as a charity under the federal Income Tax Act<ref name = " Registered charity source 1"/> <ref name = "Registered charity source 2"/>. It continues as an active organization.

From the six founders in 1981, membership in SCWIST has grown steadily. The Annual General Meeting held each spring and open to all members of the Society, votes on major decisions and elects the Executive Board of Directors. The Board is headed by the Society's president and meets regularly in Vancouver, while much of the on-going work of SCWIST is carried out by a number of standing and ad hoc committees appointed by the Board. Major milestones in SCWIST history include:
*the production of the Registry of Skilled Women, BC and Yukon (1983), 
*the organization of the first National Conference on Women in Science and Technology (1983), 
*the development of the educational programs Girls in Science<ref name="Beginning of Ms Infinity">{{cite news |last=Szpitun |first=Lin|date=1991 |title=Women Do Math and Ms Infinity: Two Projects for Girls Who Like Math |url=http://en.copian.ca/litweb/other/cclow/newslet/1991/sumer_v9/cover.pdf|language=English and French|newspaper=WOMEN'S EDUCATION DES FEMMES |location=Toronto |access-date=2015-06-28}}</ref> (1984),
*ms infinity (1990) and Project Tomorrow (1993), 
*the establishment of the SCWIST scholarship (1986, renamed the Margaret Benston Scholarship in 1991), 
*the opening of the Resource Centre (1992),
*Michael Smith Endowment Fund established <ref>{{cite web| title=Dr. Michael Smith, Nobel Laureate |url=http://www.msl.ubc.ca/about/michaelsmith|publisher=[[University of British Columbia]]|accessdate=2015-06-05}}</ref>. Half of the price money from [[Nobel prize]] as well as the matching amount from different government  organizations was put into [[Vancouver Foundation]]'s Michael Smith Fund.<ref>{{cite book|title=No Ordinary Mike: Michael Smith, Nobel Laureate|author1=Eric Damer|author2=Caroline Astell|publisher=Ronsdale press|ISBN=1-55380-014-1|quote=The other half of his prize money went to Vancouver Foundation to fund public science education through Science World and the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology (SCWIST). A few colleagues were surprised by Mike's support for women - they could not remember him speaking at department meetings to support women in faculty position - but others accepted his rationale that he had always respected women as scientists and recognized that they encountered obstacles not faced by men. His first few doctoral students had been women, as were several of his most important collaborators. Behind the scenes, Mike supported women as candidates for teaching and research positions in his department, although gender parity was still a long way off.}}</ref>(1993),
