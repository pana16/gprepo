== Proposed merge with [[In-house software]] ==

Too minor for own article. Entirely lacks sources. Easily incorporated into target article. Another similar page, [[In-House Design]], redirects to [[software engineering]] as well.

:{{reply to|EvergreenFir}}  '''Support''' In my opinion both [[In-House Design]] and [[In-house software]] are candidates for speedy deletion. They are both minor and easily incorporated to [[Software engineering]].[[User:Gpeja|Gpeja]] ([[User talk:Gpeja|talk]]) 23:38, 18 August 2015 (UTC)

:Would suggest merging into [[Software development]], which is broader and more appropriate. Since there is little to merge, it's probably more a matter of where to redirect both those articles. --[[User:Boson|Boson]] ([[User talk:Boson|talk]]) 11:13, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

* '''Oppose'''  [[In-house software]] is a small article, but it's a decent topic on the issues of build vs. buy vs. commission. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 11:53, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
::{{reply to|Andy Dingley}} In-house software is not a 'decent' topic if you mean by 'decent' requiring its own article. Topics such as [[Software#Types of software]] (including in-house, outsourced, off-the-shelf) or [[Software business]] or [[Software development]] or [[Software Engineering]] are convenient places for this small piece of information. If you are able to expand this topic and support it with [[Reliable sources]], it may become 'decent'. [[User:Gpeja|Gpeja]] ([[User talk:Gpeja|talk]]) 22:17, 21 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Thankyou for explaining the basics of Wikipedia to me. Are you equally experienced in the software industry? [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 22:46, 21 August 2015 (UTC)
:::: Thankyou [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]]. It seems I have a problem in attitude. What would be a constructive thing to do in this case? Please advise as an experienced Wikipedian. I've just joined this year and have no idea what is the proper etiquette in case of disagreements. [[User:Gpeja|Gpeja]] ([[User talk:Gpeja|talk]]) 19:13, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
::::: There is a big difference in WP between the qualities of an article and the qualities of a topic. If an article is poorly written, it's quite common for it to end up at AfD where the qualities of it ''as a topic'' are then judged. This generally gives the right result: WP thus focusses on notable topics, as intended. 
::::: One of the biggest questions in commercial software is the three-way decision between buying existing software, developing it in house, or having it developed externally. Million pound projects have to choose this on a regular basis, many do not choose wisely. It's a huge issue within IT management and within software engineering.  All three of these, and their overview, are excellent in-depth articles for WP that would be valuable articles to have afterwards. There is also a vast literature out there describing the trade-offs.  There's probably even an MBA course to be had out there, just on how to choose  (someone who was thought to reliably choose well would be a valuable consultant within the industry). 
::::: By all means, list these topics at AfD if you think they're not notable as topics and unworthy of effort to develop them as articles. But I think I know what the outcome would be. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 11:40, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::Thanks for giving more explanation. This is part of my learning process as a new WP editor. It would be great help if you at least put a rough outline and your definition of in-house software. The first sentence now reads: "In-house software is a software that is produced by a corporate entity for '''purpose of using it within the organization'''. " This doesn't match what you described above. Your description is more about commercial software development process and its tradeoffs. As I see it, there is lots of commercial software out there that is combination of all of the above so there is no reason to describe in-house software by itself. It is more important to describe the decisions you mentioned as an important part of software development process. I am still curious and would like to understand your point of you and idea of this article. It would help me learn how to create a new articles and make sure they stay on WP. I know it is quite common for new articles to be deleted at first review. Is there an option to move this article in Draft of my (or the original author) space and work on it off line?

::::::: "Commercial" software is misleading as a term, because software becomes commercial when it's either bought or sold. This could be an accountant buying software in, or it could be a software house developing it in-house and then selling it. As our distinction here is mostly whether to "develop in-house or buy the work of others", then commercialism isn't the crucial difference, means of creation is. Remember too that software can be sold as applications (things that are usable by users) or libraries (things that developers use to build further software on top of).  A software house might be writing an application for sale, thus needs to write it themselves so that they then own the rights to these sales (they're a developer, not a reseller). Yet they still have to choose whether to build the component libraries within it themselves, or buy them from others.   
::::::: There's also the question of whether [[open source software]] is "commercial" or not. For most practical purposes here it is, even if there's no bill to be paid for it. It has the same technical implications (to a consumer) as commercial software: it is produced by others, it is dependent on others, but it does not require an in-house development team.
::::::: "In-house software is software that is produced by a corporate entity" is correct, but it's not necessarily for use ''only'' within that organisation. It's produced to meet the software needs of the organisation (either to use themselves or to sell on), but it is not limited to ''only'' being used internally. The case of the software application developer building or buying in a database library etc. is a simple counter-example.  The distinction is about who ''builds'' it, not who ''uses'' it.
::::::: If you want a draft space to work in, I'd suggest just creating it under [[User:Gpeja/drafts/In-house software]] or similar. It's easy to move later, you can even do it yourself.  There's also the Draft: namespace, which is useful for very new editors who don't yet have the rights to create pages in most namespaces.

::::::::[[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] Could you please comment on the article [[Insourcing]]? It is a strange term I've never heard. There is a connection to what you described above but for the business in general not only software.[[User:Gpeja|Gpeja]] ([[User talk:Gpeja|talk]]) 00:49, 3 September 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: "Insourcing" and the variants "onshoring" and "backsourcing" are recent formations that are a reaction to the fashion (early 2000s) for offshoring and outsourcing, and the general failure of those approaches. Although they can be (but not necessarily) a form of in-house development, their key feature is that they're a ''movement away from'' some previous outsourcing effort. Insourcing usually means moving development in-house, onshoring to move it to a separate developer who is locally located in-country. None of these terms are clear or particularly trustworthy, because they're used by management without the technical nous to really understand the issue, or the precision in language to maintain the distinctions clearly.
::::::::: I've even heard the awful form "expatrisourcing" which meant convincing a UK development team to leave the country and relocate to Bulgaria, where they could do the same work and be paid less  (but would avoid the language issues of native Bulgarian developers). I still don't know if that was a serious management suggestion.
::::::::: In-house development is the process of development in-house. Doesn't matter whether it has always been done in-house, or if it is a recent change from development previously done externally. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 08:50, 3 September 2015 (UTC)
::::::::: Another aspect to "in house" development is the size of the house.  If a team within a large corporate builds some software within that team (usually by one person) rather than having it done for them by the corporate IT Services monolith, that too can be seen as "in house development", as opposed to having the official heavyweight process and team build it (I don't know of a specific term for this, but would be interested to hear one). There are lots of projects facing this as an issue too. Corporate IT departments are often regarded as slow-moving and inflexible, encouraging this lightweight in-team development.
