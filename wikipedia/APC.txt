==Actions==
===Gender evaluation methodology (GEM)===
The [[Gender Evaluation Methodology]] is an evaluation methodology that integrates a [[gender analysis]] into evaluations of initiatives that use information and communications technologies (ICTs) for social change.

It was first developed in 2002 and was tried and tested by thirty community-based organisations. Since then hundreds of people have become involved in GEM's development including people who developed the tool, who train in how to use GEM, who are adapting GEM (to increase its applicability to rural ICT4D projects, telecentres, software localisation and ICT policy advocacy and who are now offering GEM evaluations on a consultancy basis. The GEM manual was written in English and has been translated into French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Arabic.<ref>[http://www.apc.org/en/node/2835/ GEM manuals]</ref> GEM was developed by the APC Women's Rights Programme (APC WRP<ref>[http://www.apcwomen.org APC Women's Networking Support Programme]</ref>).
